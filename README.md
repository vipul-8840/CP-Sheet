# CPSheet

The CP31 Sheet is a well-structured collection of problems, consisting of 31 challenges for each difficulty level on Codeforces â€” starting from 800 and going up to 1600. This means there are 31 problems rated 800, 31 rated 900, and so on, offering a total of over 250 problems. The sheet covers a wide variety of algorithmic topics, allowing programmers to build their problem-solving skills step by step as they progress through increasingly complex challenges.

It is an excellent resource for anyone looking to strengthen their fundamentals and become consistent in competitive programming.

A big thanks to the TLE ELIMINATOR team for providing such a valuable and well-curated CP sheet to the community.
